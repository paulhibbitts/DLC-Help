### Hello, and welcome to your new course site.



! Your course is visible to you as the instructor, but it is hidden from students. When you are ready, you will need to click the gear in the top, right corner, choose 'Edit settings', and choose 'Show' beside 'Course visibility', then 'Save and display'.
Need help?

There are a couple different ways you can get help in setting up and managing your course.

- Click 'FAQ' in the top menu bar of Moodle to access our [growing list of self-help tutorials](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle).
- Click '[Moodle Docs for this page](http://docs.moodle.org/35/en/course/view/onetopic)' at the bottom of every Moodle page for the (somewhat dense) Moodle documentation pages.
- [Create a ticket for the Academic Technology Ambassadors](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/Requests/TicketRequests/TicketForm.aspx?ID=hRv7mA08DtA_), or, if you can't sign in there, send an email to [elearning@twu.ca](mailto:elearning@twu.ca).

### Getting Started

There are a few things you should do before the semester starts to ensure that your students have a smooth transition to studying with you.

- [Import content from your previous cohort](http://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/organization/importing-content-from-previous-cohort).
- Change the dates on assignments and other course activities and resources.
- Delete items that you no longer need.
- [Upload your current syllabus.](http://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/activity-or-resource/adding-resources)
- [Add or edit your assignment dropboxes (if you haven't already).](http://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/activity-or-resource/creating-an-assignment-dropbox)
- [Set up your gradebook.](http://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/grade-book/gradebook-setup)
- [Add your reading lists using the EBSCO Curriculum Builder.](http://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/activity-or-resource/ebsco-curriculum-builder)
- [Add TAs to your course.](http://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/participants/add-user)
- You can delete the link to these help pages by clicking the gear, then `Edit settings` and deleting the text in the `Course summary`.

Tips

- [Check out our course design resources for ideas.](https://create.twu.ca/coursedesign/)
- Instead of uploading files, create 'Pages' so that students don't have to download anything.
- [Design your assignments so that they can be shared on your students' ePortfolios.](https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/)
- Add simple interactions to your courses with the H5P activity options.
