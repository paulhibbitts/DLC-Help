The theme is the appearance of your site. The colors, header, fonts, sidebar options, are all a part of the theme. Some themes can be customized more than others so don't be afraid to try out a few! When choosing a theme, keep in mind that your site may not initially look the thumbnail in the theme repository, but it can with some customization adjustments.
