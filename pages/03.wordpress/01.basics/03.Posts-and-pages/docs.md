Posts and Pages
===============

Although posts and pages have nearly the same editing interface and can often look very similar, there are some key differences between the two. Pages are hierarchical, whereas posts are categorical and tagged. Pages are also static, meaning they don't change often and stay present to users. Posts are dynamic meaning they "fall off" the page. Posts are also in chronological order while pages' dates are not as important.
