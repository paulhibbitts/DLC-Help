### Using Moodle
TWU provisions a Moodle site for every course that is offered for credit in every semester. Faculty do not need to do anything beyond logging into Moodle to access the site for their courses. We have listed below several tutorials designed to guide faculty through the process of setting up a minimal presence in Moodle to enable courses to proceed with minimal interruption while access to a TWU campus may be compromised for any reason (weather, illness, power loss, etc).

For shorter term interruptions to a physical campus, faculty might only need to post a link to a selection of articles using the EBSCO Curriculum Builder, and then create a discussion forum where learners engage in critical discourse about the articles. Longer term interruptions may require a more fulsome approach including uploading a syllabus, preparing assignment dropboxes and quizzes.
