Another way to present content online is to use audio and visual tools.  

### Use Audacity to record and edit audio files.
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is a free and open source audio recording and editing tool. You may want to record snippets of audio, or even a longer 'lecture' to send to your learners.

### Use PowerPoint Audio/Video
If you use PowerPoint in your class sessions, consider adding audio to explain your notes. See the following resources to get you started:
- [Record a slide show with narration and slide timings](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c)

! If your students are to give **Class Presentations**, consider asking them to use these tools in order to post their presentations online.

! To add video to your Moodle site, see [here](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Video) for instructions.
